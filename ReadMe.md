## In this Report üìö

We have successfully executed **32 queries** related to populations across various entities such as cities, regions, and continents. The queries include detailed population analysis, ranking, and segmentation based on different criteria.

We also conducted rigorous testing to ensure the correctness and reliability of our results:

- **Unit Testing**: To verify the functionality of individual components and ensure that each query returns the expected results.
- **Integration Testing**: To confirm that the queries and database interactions work seamlessly together as a whole system.

Additional efforts included:

- **Performance Testing**: Ensuring the system performs efficiently with large datasets.
- **Code Optimization**: Streamlining query performance for faster response times.


### **Requirements** ‚öôÔ∏è
1. **JDK 17**: Used for Java development.
2. **Maven**: For project build management and dependency handling.
3. **SQL Docker**: To containerize and manage the SQL database for the project.
4. **GitHub**: For version control and project repository management.
5. **Kanban**: Used for project management and task tracking.
