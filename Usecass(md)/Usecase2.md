# Use Case: Querying and Retrieving a List of Countries Organized by Population Within a Continent

## Goal in Context
As a data analyst, I want to retrieve a list of countries within a specified continent organized by population, from largest to smallest, so that I can analyze population distribution within that continent.

## Scope
Continent-specific population data.

## Level
Primary task.

## Preconditions
- The database contains accurate population data for all countries.
- The data analyst knows the name of the continent for analysis.

## Success End Condition
A complete and accurate list of countries in the specified continent, sorted by population, is retrieved and ready for analysis.

## Failed End Condition
No data is retrieved, or the list is incomplete or incorrectly sorted.

## Primary Actor
Data Analyst.

## Trigger
The data analyst requests population data for countries within a specific continent.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The data analyst selects a continent for analysis.
2. The system retrieves population data for all countries in that continent.
3. The system organizes the countries by population, from largest to smallest.
4. The system presents the ordered list to the data analyst.

## Extensions
- **Missing or incomplete population data for a country:**
    - The system skips the country and informs the data analyst of the incomplete data.
- **Query execution error (e.g., SQL error, system failure):**
    - The system notifies the data analyst of the error and suggests re-running the query or troubleshooting.

## Sub-Variations
- The data analyst may select another continent for analysis.

## Schedule
- **Due Date:** Optional, based on the analysis timeline.
