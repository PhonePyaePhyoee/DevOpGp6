# Use Case: Retrieving the Total Population of a Region

## Goal in Context
As a data analyst, I want to retrieve the total population of a specific region, so that I can analyze demographic trends and provide insights on population distribution within that region.

## Scope
Regional population data.

## Level
Primary task.

## Preconditions
- The database contains accurate and up-to-date population data for the specified region.

## Success End Condition
The total population of the specified region is retrieved and ready for analysis.

## Failed End Condition
No data is retrieved, or the reported population is incorrect.

## Primary Actor
Data Analyst.

## Trigger
The data analyst requests the total population of a specific region.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The data analyst specifies the region for which they want to retrieve the population data.
2. The system retrieves the current population data for the specified region.
3. The system presents the total population of the region to the data analyst.

## Extensions
- **Data is unavailable or outdated:**
    - The system informs the data analyst that the population data for the region is not available or needs updating.
- **Query execution error (e.g., system failure):**
    - The system notifies the data analyst of the error and suggests re-running the query.

## Sub-Variations

## Schedule
