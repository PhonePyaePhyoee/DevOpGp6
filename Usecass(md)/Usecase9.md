# 9. All the cities in a region organized by largest population to smallest

## Goal in Context
As a data analyst, I want to retrieve a list of all cities in a specific region organized by population, from largest to smallest, so that I can analyze urban population trends within that region.

## Scope
Region-specific city population data.

## Level
Primary task.

## Preconditions
- The database contains accurate population data for all cities.
- The data analyst knows the name of the region for analysis.

## Success End Condition
A complete and accurate list of cities in the specified region, sorted by population from largest to smallest, is retrieved and ready for analysis.

## Failed End Condition
No data is retrieved, or the list is incomplete or incorrectly sorted.

## Primary Actor
Data Analyst. (Backup coder)

## Trigger
The data analyst requests population data for cities within a specific region.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The data analyst selects a region for analysis.
2. The system retrieves population data for all cities in that region.
3. The system organizes the cities from largest to smallest population.
4. The system presents the ordered list to the data analyst.

## Extensions
- **Missing or incomplete population data for a city:**
    - The system skips the city and informs the data analyst of the incomplete data.
- **Query execution error (e.g., system failure):**
    - The system notifies the data analyst of the error and suggests re-running the query.

## Sub-Variations
- The data analyst may select another region for analysis.

## Schedule
**Due Date**: Optional, based on the analysis timeline.
