# Use Case: Querying and Retrieving a List of Countries Organized by Population

## Goal in Context
As a data analyst, I want to query and retrieve a list of all countries organized by population from largest to smallest so that I can analyze global population trends.

## Scope
World population data.

## Level
Primary task.

## Preconditions
- The database contains up-to-date and accurate population data for all countries.
- The data analyst has access to the database and necessary tools (e.g., IntelliJ,docker,Xampp).

## Success End Condition
A complete and accurate list of countries, sorted by population, is retrieved and ready for analysis.

## Failed End Condition
No data is retrieved, or the list is incomplete or incorrectly sorted.

## Primary Actor
Data Analyst (Coder)

## Trigger
The data analyst initiates a query to retrieve population data for analysis.

## Main Success Scenario
1. The data analyst requests a list of countries organized by population.
2. The system runs a query against the database to retrieve population data.
3. The system organizes the countries from the largest to the smallest population.
4. The system displays or outputs the organized data to the data analyst for further analysis.

## Extensions
- **Missing or incomplete population data:**
    - The system identifies missing data and informs the data analyst of the issue.
- **Query execution error (e.g., SQL error, database unavailable):**
    - The system informs the data analyst of the error and suggests possible resolutions (e.g., re-executing the query).

## Sub-Variations
None.

## Schedule
- **Due Date:** Optional, depending on the release or analysis timeline.
