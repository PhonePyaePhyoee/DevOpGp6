# 31. The Population of a City

## Goal in Context
As a data analyst, I want to retrieve the population data for a specific city so that I can analyze demographic trends within that city.

## Scope
City-specific population data.

## Level
Primary task.

## Preconditions
- The database contains accurate population data for all cities.
- The data analyst knows the name of the city for analysis.

## Success End Condition

## Failed End Condition

## Trigger

## Main Success Scenario
1. The data analyst specifies the city for which population data is needed.
2. The system retrieves the population data for the specified city.
3. The system presents the population data to the data analyst.

## Extensions

    - The system informs the data analyst that the specified city does not exist in the database.
- **Query execution error (e.g., system failure):**
    - The system notifies the data analyst of the error and suggests re-running the query.
